# MDV E-Commerce Platform - Role-Based Access Control Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive audit reveals significant gaps in the role-based access control (RBAC) system, particularly around logistics functions and payment status update permissions. While the platform has a well-defined role structure, implementation is incomplete and inconsistent.

## 🔍 Current Role Structure

### Defined Roles
- **Admin** (`admin`) - Super user with all permissions
- **Supervisor** (`supervisor`) - Management level with most permissions
- **Operations** (`operations`) - Product/inventory management, order fulfillment
- **Logistics** (`logistics`) - Shipping and delivery management

### Role Groups (Backend)
```python
ALL_STAFF = (Role.admin, Role.supervisor, Role.operations, Role.logistics)
FULFILLMENT_STAFF = (Role.admin, Role.supervisor, Role.operations)
LOGISTICS_STAFF = (Role.admin, Role.supervisor, Role.logistics)
SUPERVISORS = (Role.admin, Role.supervisor)
ADMINS = (Role.admin,)
```

## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Missing Logistics User Functions

#### **Current State Analysis**
- **Backend**: Logistics role has minimal permissions defined
- **Frontend**: No logistics-specific dashboard or UI components
- **Functionality**: Limited to basic shipment status updates

#### **Logistics Permissions (Current)**
```python
Role.logistics: {
    Permission.PRODUCT_VIEW,           # View only
    Permission.INVENTORY_VIEW,         # View only  
    Permission.ORDER_VIEW,
    Permission.ORDER_EDIT,
    Permission.REPORT_VIEW,
    Permission.ANALYTICS_VIEW,
}
```

#### **Missing Logistics Functions**
1. **Shipping Management Dashboard**
   - No dedicated logistics dashboard
   - No shipment overview/tracking interface
   - No delivery route optimization tools

2. **Warehouse Operations**
   - No picking/packing workflow
   - No warehouse location management
   - No inventory movement tracking

3. **Delivery Tracking**
   - Limited shipment status updates
   - No delivery confirmation workflow
   - No customer delivery notifications

4. **Logistics Analytics**
   - No shipping performance metrics
   - No delivery time analytics
   - No carrier performance tracking

#### **Existing Logistics Endpoints (Limited)**
- `POST /api/admin/shipments` - Create shipment (LOGISTICS_STAFF)
- `POST /api/admin/shipments/{id}/status` - Update status (LOGISTICS_STAFF)

### Issue 2: Payment Status Update Permissions

#### **Current Problem**
- **All staff roles** can modify payment status regardless of payment method
- **No Paystack integration checks** for payment status locks
- **No role-based restrictions** on payment modifications

#### **Current Implementation**
```python
@router.put("/orders/{oid}")
async def admin_update_order(
    # ... 
    claims=Depends(require_roles(*ALL_STAFF))  # ❌ All staff can modify
):
    # Payment status mapping - no restrictions
    if body.payment_status is not None:
        mapping = {
            "pending": OrderStatus.pending_payment,
            "paid": OrderStatus.paid,
            "refunded": OrderStatus.refunded,
        }
        order.status = mapping.get(body.payment_status)  # ❌ No checks
```

#### **Required Fix**
- Only **Admin** users should modify payment status for non-Paystack orders
- **Paystack orders** should be read-only for all users (including Admin)
- **Logistics/Operations** should never modify payment status

## 📊 Detailed Permission Analysis

### Admin Role ✅ (Properly Implemented)
- Full access to all functions
- User management capabilities
- System settings and analytics
- All CRUD operations

### Supervisor Role ✅ (Properly Implemented)  
- Most admin functions except user management
- Order cancellation and refunds
- Analytics and reporting
- Product management

### Operations Role ⚠️ (Partially Implemented)
- **Working**: Product/inventory management, order fulfillment
- **Missing**: Advanced inventory analytics, bulk operations
- **Issue**: Can modify payment status (should not)

### Logistics Role ❌ (Severely Underimplemented)
- **Working**: Basic shipment status updates
- **Missing**: 90% of expected logistics functions
- **Issue**: Can modify payment status (should not)

## 🔧 Implementation Gaps

### Frontend Navigation Issues
```typescript
// Current admin layout shows same nav for all roles
const navigationSections = [
  {
    name: 'Catalog Management',
    items: [
      { name: 'Products', roles: ['admin', 'supervisor', 'operations'] },
      // ❌ No logistics-specific sections
    ]
  }
]
```

### Backend Permission Enforcement
- **Inconsistent**: Some endpoints use role groups, others use individual roles
- **Missing**: Granular permission checks for specific actions
- **Problem**: Payment modification not restricted by role

### Database Schema Gaps
- **Missing**: Logistics-specific tables (routes, warehouses, carriers)
- **Missing**: Payment method tracking for permission checks
- **Missing**: Audit trails for logistics operations

## 🎯 Recommended Solutions

### Phase 1: Payment Status Restrictions (High Priority)

#### Backend Changes
1. **Add payment method tracking** to orders
2. **Implement Paystack detection** logic
3. **Restrict payment status updates** by role and payment method

#### Frontend Changes
1. **Disable payment status field** for non-admin users
2. **Show read-only status** for Paystack orders
3. **Add permission-based UI rendering**

### Phase 2: Logistics Function Implementation (Medium Priority)

#### New Logistics Dashboard
1. **Shipment overview** with filtering/search
2. **Delivery tracking** interface
3. **Warehouse operations** workflow
4. **Logistics analytics** and reporting

#### New Backend Endpoints
1. **Logistics dashboard** API
2. **Warehouse management** endpoints
3. **Delivery confirmation** workflow
4. **Carrier integration** APIs

### Phase 3: Permission System Enhancement (Low Priority)

#### Granular Permissions
1. **Resource-level permissions** (own orders vs all orders)
2. **Action-specific permissions** (view vs edit vs delete)
3. **Context-aware permissions** (order status-based access)

## 📋 Implementation Priority Matrix

| Issue | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Payment status restrictions | High | Low | **Critical** |
| Logistics dashboard | Medium | High | **High** |
| Warehouse operations | Medium | High | **Medium** |
| Granular permissions | Low | Medium | **Low** |
