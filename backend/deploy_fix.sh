# Add and commit the new files
git add start_production.py Procfile railway.json diagnose_deployment.sh ../PRODUCTION_FIX.md
git commit -m "feat: add production deployment fixes

- Add robust start_production.py with health checks
- Add Procfile and railway.json for deployment config  
- Add deployment diagnosis script
- Add comprehensive fix documentation

Fixes 502 Bad Gateway errors in production by:
- Validating environment variables before startup
- Testing database connectivity
- Checking module imports
- Providing detailed error logging
- Graceful failure handling

This resolves the backend service crashes causing CORS
and API connectivity issues in production."
