## Conclusion

The MDV frontend currently provides basic e-commerce functionality but falls short of modern user expectations. The identified issues span from critical functional gaps (mobile navigation, customer accounts) to polish elements (animations, visual consistency). 

The recommended phased approach prioritizes high-impact, user-facing improvements while building toward a comprehensive, modern e-commerce experience. With the implementation of mock data and simulated backend functionality, we can validate the complete user experience before backend development, reducing risk and ensuring a polished product launch.

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this audit report
2. Prioritize features based on business goals
3. Begin implementation of Phase 1 (Design System)
4. Set up proper development environment with mocks
5. Establish testing and review processes
