# MDV Backend & Frontend Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-08-26

### 1. ✅ Fixed Order Model Relationships (COMPLETED)

**Issue:** Order model was missing proper bidirectional relationships with OrderItem, Address, and Fulfillment models.

**Solution:**
- Added `back_populates` relationship from OrderItem to Order
- Added `back_populates` relationship from Address to Order  
- Added `back_populates` relationship from Fulfillment to Order

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/mdv/models.py`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Import Path Issues (COMPLETED)

**Issue:** Import paths were using `backend.mdv` instead of `mdv` causing ModuleNotFoundError.

**Solution:**
- Updated all import statements from `from backend.mdv` to `from mdv`
- Fixed imports in all API routers and dependencies

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/api/main.py`
- `/backend/api/deps.py`
- `/backend/api/routers/*.py` (all router files)

### 3. ✅ Configured Cloudinary for Development (COMPLETED)

**Issue:** Cloudinary was not configured and missing required packages.

**Solution:**
- Installed `cloudinary` and `python-multipart` packages
- Updated `cloudinary_utils.py` to handle unconfigured state gracefully
- Added mock responses for development when Cloudinary URL is not set
- Image upload endpoints now work without actual Cloudinary account in development

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/mdv/cloudinary_utils.py`
- `/backend/.env`

### 4. ✅ Fixed Frontend Authentication Flow (COMPLETED)

**Issue:** Frontend was not including JWT token in API requests after login.

**Solution:**
- Updated `api-client.ts` to include Authorization header with Bearer token from cookies
- Token is now properly forwarded in all authenticated requests

**Files Modified:**
- `/web/lib/api-client.ts`

## Current Status

### Backend (Port 8000)
- ✅ Running successfully
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Orders endpoint functional
- ✅ User profile endpoint functional
- ✅ Image upload endpoints functional (mock mode in development)

### Frontend (Port 3000)
- ✅ Can be started with `npm run dev`
- ✅ Authentication flow working
- ✅ API communication with backend established

## Testing Commands

### Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Test Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@mdv.ng", "password": "admin123"}'
```

### Test Authenticated Endpoint
```bash
TOKEN="your-jwt-token"
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/users/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite for development
- `REDIS_URL`: Memory store for development
- `JWT_SECRET`: Set for authentication
- `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Empty for mock mode in development

### Frontend (.env.local)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: http://localhost:8000

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Configure Actual Cloudinary Account:**
   - Sign up for Cloudinary account
   - Get API credentials
   - Update `CLOUDINARY_URL` in backend .env

2. **Set up proper Redis:**
   - Install and configure Redis server
   - Update `REDIS_URL` in backend .env

3. **Configure PostgreSQL:**
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` in backend .env

4. **Security:**
   - Generate strong JWT_SECRET
   - Configure proper CORS origins
   - Set secure cookies in production

## Notes

- The system now works fully in development mode without external dependencies
- Cloudinary image uploads return placeholder URLs when not configured
- All model relationships are properly configured and tested
