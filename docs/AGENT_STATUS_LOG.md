This file is a running log for ongoing work and current focus. Update it as tasks progress to maintain continuity.

Session: 2025-08-24
- Completed: Comprehensive analysis across backend, worker, web, scripts, and infra.

  - CONFIG_SECURITY_REVIEW.md, DEVOPS_DEPLOYMENT_CHECK.md, DOCS_REVIEW.md, SCAN_SUMMARY.md

- Next planned P0 work (upon approval to implement):
