## üí° Conclusion

The MDV e-commerce platform has successfully implemented all critical MVP features (P0) needed for a functional online store. The system can:
- Display and sell products
- Manage shopping carts
- Process payments
- Handle orders
- Deploy to production

The main gaps are in enhanced features (P1) like customer accounts and advanced search, and optimizations (P2) like performance and SEO. These can be added incrementally based on business priorities.

**The platform is production-ready for basic e-commerce operations.**
